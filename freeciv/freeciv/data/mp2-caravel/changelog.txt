Ongoing goals of MP2-Caravel
1. Increase splendor of the Bronze Age. Define your national race, characteristics, and unique path.
2. Attempt the Final Re-balance of what 2x movement rates have done to foot units.
   Make Foot units a true tactical component again.
3. Re-balance of Govs toward the vibe and vision of what we know it should be like.
4. Enhance Trade routes and other mechanics to increase the Diplomatic / Economic bloc / Sovereign concerns of
   each individual nation:  Nerf mechanics forcing gang-alliance loyalties.


BUILDINGS AND WONDERS:
1. Colossus: +1 trade on ALL tiles (not just existing trade), +1 trade on city center, -5 cost on most commerce units built in that city.
2. Hanging Gardens now costs 210 and is obsolete by Steam Engine: 
   increase diversity of other early wonder strategies
   encourage Frigates before Ironclads
   more difficult for representative govs to rapture simultaneous to mid-game invasions
3. Police Station prevents investigate city for all govs except Democracy.
4. Courthouse prevents Diplomats (not Spies) from doing hostile Embassy without first cease-fire or peace.

GOVERNMENT RE-BALANCE:
* ALL NON-REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENTS:
1. Courthouse gives +1 content to all govs, not just Democracy 
2. Statue of Zeus makes 1 citizen content about military for govs who need that, and for those who don't, simply 1 citizen content.
3. Also see: Police Station
* FUNDAMENTALISM:
1. Fundamentalist govs are harder to bribe, cost is 2x.
2. A Pilgrim may use ONE of the multi-build-slots in a city with Conscription bonus, along with Foot Soldiers (e.g. Fanatics)
3. Fundamentalist government now joins Democracy/Communism to get the "generate partisans" effect.
4. Fanatics can skirmish assault cities which have foreign populations (e.g., your recently conquered city)
5. Pilgrams have no pop_cost. Effectively, it's "rapture you can geographically direct, for 10 shields"
6. -50% bulbs in exchange for basically free upkeep on temples and make_content buildings, was a raw deal. 
   a. in addition to the 1 gold for every +1 content, penalties are symmetric balanced now, -20% for sci, +20% for gold.
* COMMUNISM:
1. A Proletarian may use ONE of the multi-build-slots in a city with Conscription bonus, along with Foot Soldiers (e.g. Riflemen)
2. Communists 10 shield discount on Armor.
3. Proletarians have 1 pop_cost but add 2 pop. Essentially same +1 net pop as Pilgrims, but can magnify helping out "boom-towns" to grow.
* DEMOCRACY:
1. Democracy has base corruption level of 8%, (50% of Republic/Monarchy)
2. Democracy corruption increases by 0.4% per tile from capital (1/5 that of other govs)
3. Democracies can now be BRIBED, but costs 3x. 
4. Democacies can now be INCITED TO REVOLT, but costs 3x.
5. Also see, Hanging Gardens, Police Station

UNITS/COMBAT/MECHANICS:
* FOOT UNITS
1. Early foot soldiers can convert to Musketeers for free in domestic cities upon discovering Conscription.
   Musketeers to Riflemen with Labor Union.
2. Pre-feudal foot units (Warrior, Archer, Phalanx, Legion) cost 20% less.
3. Feudal foot units (Pikemen) cost 10% less.
4. Marines can now: build Fort/Airbase, gain +2 move frags per vet level, and v2+ can do ranged bazooka attack for 3 rounds.
   Marines cost 55.
5. Paratroopers A7 D5. Cost 55.
6. Partisan cost 45.
7. SPECIAL UNIT ATTACKS
   Tactical depth blossoms: Can allow hit and run, in some cases multiple ranged attacks per turn.
      Phalanx rumble attack: 3 combat rounds, stays fortified, can hit 1 unit, can kill no units, uses 5/9 moves
      Legion pilum assault: 1 combat round, 2x attack, can hit 2 units, can kill 2 units, uses 1 move.
      Archers volley attack: 2 combat rounds (was 1), stays fortified, can hit up to 7 units (was unlimited), can kill no units, uses 1 5/9 moves (was turn loss), can attack water.
      Fanatics skirmish assault: 3 combat rounds, can hit up to 4 units, can kill no units, uses 1 5/9 moves. Now, can also assault conquered foreign-occupied cities.
      Marines bazooka attack: 3 combat rounds, can hit up to 4 units, can kill 1 unit, uses 1 5/9 moves can do oceanic (but not transported)
      Battleship bombard: 3 combat rounds, 4 units, can kill 1, uses 5 moves.
   STANDARD ATTACKS
      Phalanx and Marines can stay fortified during attack.
1. Price changes: pre-feudal units -20% foot soldiers, -10% mounted. Catapult 34. Feudal: -10% foot, -5% mounted. Armor II: 85 (was 80)
2. Siege Ram, A2 D1 M2, must use roads, 50% chance to destroy city walls (requires 1 full move point), odds halved against capitals.
     up to 4hp damage on each tile, emulating up to 80% reduction of Fortress defense bonus; which may be partly/fully repaired/recovered each successive turn.
    One ram is effective at (up to) 80% reduction of Fortress defense bonus, though the strongest and possibly least effective unit will defend first.
      This still greatly facilitates the probably still rather costly proposition of taking a Fortress.
    Two rams will likely be effective at almost totally eradicating the Fortress defense bonus. Troops foolish enough to remain in a Fortress facing two siege 
    rams can be demoralized and incapacitated from falling and crashing stone debris. If they are proactive they may deliberately pillage sections of the Fortress
    to render it un-rammable, which effectively leaves it as a solid unrammable Fort with 1.33x bonus.
3. Satellite: invisible, can investigate all cities (even with Police Station), has superior vision and movement. Requires Apollo Program.
4. TEST Helicopter not susceptible to City Walls but rather SAM Battery (fixes a nerf of 3x for a land unit not from original game)
5. Shift from shield to gold upkeep for Infantry changed from Labor Union to Banking. Allows realistic foot soldier compositions to affect more of the game.
6. Battleship gets ranged attack: 3 rounds, can hit up to 4 units, can kill up to 1 unit, uses 5 moves.
7. Truck replaces Freight. Changes: Road only, moves: 5, can carry 3 land units.
8. Discovery of Recycling reduces unit upgrades 20%, stacks with other discounts.
9. A server flaw sometimes
   a. allowed military units to clean fallout and pollution. This fix affects ALL rulesets.
   b. For non-military units, only spies and worker types can pillage now. Excluded are: Caravans, Explorers, Diplomats, Pilgrims, Freight.
SPIES/DIPLOMATS:
9. Diplomatic units can now defend a unit on a tile from hostile diplomatic acts (bribe/sabotage), the same as they can for a city.
   a. In the case where actions aren't possible (i.e., other units > 1), no defense is necessary since it's "No action possible."
   b. Where it is only the case of 1 diplomat vs. 1 enemy diplomat, they enter into diplomatic combat, the same as in a city.
   c. Spies promotion odds increased to compensate for the weaker strength of their veterancy levels, to make it track more similar 
      to other units for number of successful surviving actions.
OTHER:
Casus Belli Expansions:
1. In a foreign territory casus belli is given by:  Transforming Terrain, Building Base, or making road-types (road,rail,quay,canal,etc.)
2. Bribe enemy unit.
3. Found City on foreign territory (i.e., in a Fort.)
4. Capture Units (server bug fix allows it now.)

MINOR AND MISC.
---------------
Conscription does not allow making multiple Caravans per turn.
Traderoutes add a hard +1 trade to the city centre
Spy Plane correctly made to be unreachable to propeller-based aircraft.
Can't make road-types while transported in foreign lands (road/quay/rail/maglev/canal)
   move to mp2-brava
+1/9 move bonus for v4+ aircraft was changed to +1, as it too frequently led to death of precious v4 units from tired attack on last move.
   move to MP2-brava
Ships cost 2x to bribe -- injured ships far from home had too low bribe costs for what you're getting.
Ram Ship can see 1 tile around it and travel on rivers - prevents unintended attacks when travelling diagonally.
   move to MP2-brava (except not the travel on river part)
Damaged Submarine min_speed=4 (was 3); makes hit-and-run and escape somewhat more viable.
Nuclear winter is was patches of random arctic everywhere, now is more of a temperature downgrade of each affected tile to one level colder.

SERVER UPGRADES: 
1. Special Unit Actions / Attacks:
   a. can optionally specify a move cost up to 7 moves points.
   b. can optionally specify a limit to number of units on tile which can be hit
   c. can optionally specify a maximum number of units who can be potentially killed
   d. can optionally specify a unit stays fortified when doing the action.
2. Population units can specify pop-cost and add-pop differently. 
3. Non-diplomatic units can be made to enter "direct combat with buildings": e.g., Siege Ram vs. City Walls. 
4. Added "gold per shield" displays to Purchase pop-ups and as a sortable user column in cities list. 
5. Bulb cost displays now reflect non-default sciencebox settings 
6. Fixed design flaw in server that made pop-cost units prohibit multi-units-per-turn city production.  
7. Made units-display in lower-right always update instead of still show dead/spent/disbanded units. 
8. Fixed a cheat/exploit/backdoor in bribe mechanics. 
9. DIPLOMATIC ACTION REPORTING TRANSPARENCY: all diplomatic actions show the odds and results for all stages to both contestants.
10. Unit vision range now reported in raw tile units rather than square of radius.
11. Fortresses and Naval Bases show a flag of who owns them to prevent confusion. 
12. Fixed variety of small quirks/inconsistencies in loading/unloading of transports.
13. Added ability for rulesets to include the "Sea Bridge" improvement over water.
14. DOC HOTKEYS.MP:: Intelligent Load/Unload/Activate Cargo are now a Holstic Suite of upgraded mechanics which all work together:
   UNLOAD TRANSPORT 'T':
    a. 'T' tells a selected Transport(s) to unload their specific cargo.
    b. 'T' tells selected Cargo to unload from their Transports. 
   LOAD 'L': 
    a. 'L' command tells selected unloaded units which Transport to load onto (if multiple legal transport exists).
    b. 'L' command tells selected Transports to 'scoop up' all units on the tile which it can legally take as cargo.
    c. 'L' command tells selected Cargo units to transfer to another Transport IFF such action is legal OR would be legal 
           after the cargo unloaded with no movement penalty (e.g., in a City.)
    d. 'L' command given at Sea, to tell selected Cargo to move to a new Transport, is legal if current Transport has spent neither
           half its moves nor more than 4 moves. This: handicaps "transport shuffling" to nearly infeasible while still facilitating 
           ordinary logistical operations and reducing micro-management.
   SELECT CARGO on TRANSPORT 'U':
    a. 'U' command given to selected Transports will only activate/select Cargo units on user-selected Transport(s).
    b. To select ALL cargo on ALL transports (old behaviour), select any non-Transport when hitting 'U'
   What no longer happens:
   1. 'T' will never unload unselected transport/cargo units. Previously, it unloaded ALL cargo on same tile.
   2. 'U' command will never select all cargo on same tile, only on selected Transports.
   3. 'L' command won't disallow changing Transports in cities because you didn't take micro-management step of unloading first.
   4. 'L' command doesn't force you to select every embarking unit on a tile, but gives options to select the Transport who scoops up instead.
   5. 'L' command won't disallow more ordinary logistics like transfering cargo at sea to an allied Transport, or having a Transport in a city 
         come pick up units from a Transport 2 tiles away, or having a city Transport drop off cargo to NEARBY Transport on its "shipping lane."
14a. Can "transport swap" in
   1) cities 
   2) in ships & gunships who have neither moved more than 4 moves NOR 
       move more than half their moves;

       Transports who moved no more than 4 moves AND have min. of 3 moves left, may cargo swap. 

   Every other type of transported-scenario, swapping is not allowed. */
16. Hovering over a Special Unit Attack will give helptext for all its special parameters.
17. Fixed rounding errors in displayed upgrade costs on client side.
18. Fixed upstream server bug that didn't allow capture units to trigger casus belli.
19. Added ability for effects to be triggered by unit activity states (isntead of only completed actions.)
20. There was a hidden flaw in 3.0 server, any unit who can do ANYTHING to a tile gets magic bonus to also clean pollution and fallout. 
      This was affecting foot soldiers (who can make hideouts) so we went with the flow. But now this flaw is fixed, and only non-military 
      we're back to the classical orthodoxy:  only non-military tile workers can clean fallout and pollution (worker, engineer, settler, proletarian)
