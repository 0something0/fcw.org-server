Ongoing goals of MP2-Caravel
1. Increase splendor of the Bronze Age. Define your national race, characteristics, and unique path.
2. Attempt the Final Re-balance of what 2x movement rates have done to foot units.
   Make Foot units a true tactical component again.
3. Re-balance of Govs toward the vibe and vision of what we know it should be like.
4. Enhance Trade routes and other mechanics to increase the Diplomatic / Economic bloc / Sovereign concerns of
   each individual nation:  Nerf mechanics forcing gang-alliance loyalties.

BUILDINGS AND WONDERS:
1. Colossus: +1 trade on city center, -5 cost on most commerce units built in that city.
2. Hanging Gardens now costs 210 and is obsolete by Steam Engine: 
   increase diversity of other early wonder strategies
   encourage Frigates before Ironclads
   more difficult for representative govs to rapture simultaneous to mid-game invasions
3. Police Station prevents investigate city for all govs except Democracy.
4. Courthouse prevents Diplomats (not Spies) from doing hostile Embassy without first cease-fire or peace.

GOVERNMENT RE-BALANCE:
* ALL NON-REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENTS:
1. Courthouse gives +1 content to all govs, not just Democracy 
2. Statue of Zeus makes 1 citizen content about military for govs who need that, and if not, simply 1 citizen content.
* FUNDAMENTALISM:
1. Fundamentalist govs are harder to bribe, cost is 2x.
2. Pilgrams have no pop_cost. Effectively, it's rapture that costs 10 shields. Pilgrims use ONE city-build-slot instead of all.
3. Fundamentalist now gets the "generate partisans" effect.
4. Fanatics can skirmish assault cities which have foreign populations (e.g., your recently conquered city)
5. -50% bulbs in exchange for free upkeep on temples/make_content buildings, was a penalty. Changed to:  
   a. Bonus/penalty is symmetric now: -20% for sci, +20% for gold.
* COMMUNISM:
1. Proletarians have 1 pop_cost but add 2 pop. Same +1 net pop as Pilgrims, but can better use granary dynamics and magnify state populace control of "boom-town" growth. One city build slot used, not all.
2. Communists: 10 shield discount on Armor I.
* DEMOCRACY:
1. Democracy has base corruption level of 8%, (half of Republic/Monarchy)
2. Democracy: corruption increases by 0.4% per tile from capital (1/5 that of most other govs (=2%))
3. Democracies can now be BRIBED, but cost is 3x. 
4. Democacies can now be INCITED TO REVOLT, but cost is 3x.
5. Also see, Hanging Gardens, Police Station

UNITS/COMBAT/MECHANICS:
* FOOT UNITS
1. "Hand-me-down upgrade bonus":
   Early foot convert to Musketeers for free in domestic cities upon discovering Conscription.
   Musketeers "        " Riflemen    "    "   "    "        "     "      "       Labor Union.
2. Pre-feudal foot units (Warrior, Archer, Phalanx, Legion) cost 20% less.
3. Feudal foot units (Pikemen) cost 10% less.
4. Marines can now: build Fort/Airbase 
      Gain +2 move frags per vet level
      V2+ can do ranged Bazooka Attack for 3 rounds on up to 2 targets.
      Note this does not represent superior range of Marines to other units/weaponry, but rather
         special commando training for fast initiative surprise degradation tactics, concealment advantage, etc.
      Marines cost 55 (was 60).
5. Paratroopers A7 D5. Cost 55 (was 60)
6. Partisans cost 45 (was 50).
7. Shift from shield to gold upkeep for Infantry changed from Labor Union to Banking. Allows realistic foot soldier compositions to affect more of the game.
* SPECIAL UNIT ABILITIES - This is a new MP2 design goal to increase tactical depth, unit diversity, playstyle variety, realism accuracy, and even further reduce "golden pathing" of military strategies.
1. SPECIAL UNIT ATTACKS. Tactical depth blossoms: Now possible are: Hit-and-run tactics; multiple ranged attacks per turn; engagements with less than all units on the tile.
      Phalanx, Rumble Attack: 3 combat rounds, stays fortified, can hit 1 unit, can kill no units, uses 5/9 moves, requires 1 move left, requires fortified or not moved prior.
      Legion, Pilum Assault: 1 combat round, 2x attack, can hit 2 units, can kill 2 units, uses 1 move.
      Archers, Volley attack: 2 combat rounds (was 1), stays fortified, can hit up to 7 units (was unlimited), can kill no units, uses 1 5/9 moves (was turn loss), can attack water.
      Fanatics, Skirmish assault: 3 combat rounds, can hit up to 4 units, can kill no units, uses 1 5/9 moves. Now, can also assault conquered foreign-occupied cities.
      Marines, Bazooka attack: 3 combat rounds, can hit up to 4 units, can kill 1 unit, uses 1 5/9 moves, can hit oceanic (but not while transported)
      Battleship, Bombard attack: 3 combat rounds, 4 units, can kill 1, uses 5 moves.
2. iPILLAGE. Instant Pillage is tactically significant. Formerly, roads under rails couldn't be pillaged in one turn. Scorched Earth and Blitz tactics barely existed in the game.
      NOTE: iPillage Odds increase +5% per vet level.
      Dive Bomber - 50% odds, 1 selectable target, 7 move cost. 
      Ground Strike Fighter - 75% odds, 1 selectable target, 3 moves cost.
      Armor I/II - 75% odds, 1 selectable target, 2 move cost.
      Strategic Bomber - 60% odds, 1 random target, 3 move cost.
      Jet Bomber - 75% odds, 2 random targets, 3 move cost.
3. SPECIAL STANDARD ATTACKS
      Phalanx and Marines can stay fortified during attack.
* PRICE CHANGES
    Pre-feudal units -20% foot, -10% mounted. Catapult 34.
    Feudal:          -10% foot, -5% mounted.  Armor II: 85 (was 80)
* UNITS:
1. Siege Ram: Must use roads. SPECIAL UNIT ATTACKS:
    Attack City Walls. 50% chance to destroy city walls (requires 1 full move point), odds halved against capitals.
    Ram Fortress:      attack on fortified walls is emulated by up to 4hp damage on each occupant, emulating a 0 to 80% reduction of Fortress defense bonus; which may be partly/fully repaired/recovered each successive turn.
    Two Rams will likely render Fortress defense into liability. Troops who remain in a Fortress facing two Siege Rams will be damaged and demoralized from breaches
    and crushing stone debris. But, proactive defenders can pillage the Fortress and use its stone to improvise fortified structures. That is, render the tile into an
    unrammable Fort which enjoys a 1.33x bonus protection from stack kill.
    The net effect of this realistically emulates that Fortresses are dominant military presences until attackers take the time and wherewithal to get around 
    to protracted siege, whereafter they are still defendable but at a lesser bonus.
2. Satellite: invisible, can investigate all cities (even with Police Station), has superior vision and movement. Requires Apollo Program.
3. Zeppelin:  upgrades balloon, greater vision/movement/fuel, some limited attack capabilities, can do limited bombing.
4. Helicopter fixed, correctly susceptible to SAM Battery not City Walls (fixes a nerf of 3x for a land unit not from original game)
   this fix was retroactive to AG and Brava also, as it was a really bad treason against the branch's DNA.
5. Battleship gets ranged attack: 3 rounds, can hit up to 4 units, can kill up to 1 unit, uses 5 moves.
6. Truck replaces Freight. Changes: Road only, moves: 6, can carry 3 land units. load/unload rules same as Train.
7. Discovery of Recycling reduces unit upgrades 20%, stacks with other discounts.
8. A server flaw sometimes
   a. allowed military units to clean fallout and pollution. This fix affects ALL rulesets.
   b. For non-military units, only spies and worker types can pillage now. Excluded are: Caravans, Explorers, Diplomats, Pilgrims, Tribesmen, Trucks, Freight.
SPIES/DIPLOMATS:
9. Diplomatic units now defend a unit on a tile from hostile diplomatic acts (bribe/sabotage), the same as they defend a city from hostile diplomat attacks.
   a. In the case where bribe/sabotage isn't possible (i.e., other non-diplomat units > 1), no defense is necessary since it's "No action possible."
   b. Where it is only the case of 1 diplomat vs. 1 enemy diplomat, they enter into diplomatic combat, the same as in a city.
   c. Spies promotion odds increased to compensate for the weaker strength of their veterancy levels, to make it track more similar 
      to other units for number of successful surviving actions.
10. Investigate City is now no longer hard-coded in server to 100% success. What this means for MP2:
   80% chance to COVERTLY SLIP past enemy diplomats/spies WITHOUT diplomatic combat. (100% if unprotected)
   If slipped past OR defeated enemy diplomats in combat, 85% chance to succeed at investigating city.
   FINAL ODDS: 
      85% chance to investigate unprotected city
      ~75% chance to succeed vs. protected city (varies slightly up or down with the vet levels of the spy units in combat.)
      causes casus belli on failure!

OTHER:
1.Casus Belli Expansions:
   a. In a foreign territory casus belli is given by:  Transforming Terrain, Building Base, or making road-types (road,rail,quay,canal,etc.)
   b. Bribe enemy unit.
   c. Found City on foreign territory (i.e., in a Fort.)
   d. Capture Units (fixed an unknown server bug that allows this to work now.)
2. Improved tuning of terrain dispersion; less domination in some areas by a single terrain type.
3. Balance Alignment of Resource Distribution (BARD. 1. On the first TC, BARD allocates a SMALL amount of:
   Berries, Spice, Peat, Oasis, Rubber, Gems, Elk, Furs, Ivory, and Iron, in order to enhance statistical
   balance in each climactic region. Typically this is less than a 4% chance per tile, with exact value tuned to regional
   geographic balance. (Swamp and Arctic get somewhat more.) 2. BARD overcomes the map generator's forced 35%
   chance a tile gets a resource, regardless of terrain, resource type, or scarcity of nearby resources on other tiles.
   3. BARD discourages settling on the first turn, giving one turn of "oxygen" for all players to look around before settling
   their cities. This was preferred to proposals to disallow settling on first turn, or to exaggerate inconsistent special
   exception bonuses for starting moves, exceptions to terrain movement penalties for x turns, etc., etc.
3a. Furs can now exist on Arctic terrain. This provides more balance to the worst terrain type in the game.
4. "Blood for Oil":  After Refining, Oil Wells built on Oil get +1 shield after other bonuses. 
     (Previously, it was arguably better to irrigate rather than mine.) Oil tiles with more value are now more worth fighting for.

MINOR AND MISC.
---------------
Conscription bonus simplified - applies to infantry only.
Traderoutes add a hard +1 trade to the city centre
Commerce units simplified. All commerce can build wonders and do trade routes at all times under all conditions.
   Trade tech isn't needed for Trade routes. Trade tech simply increases Trade revenue higher rates.
Galleon, like Caravel,Galley,etc., can enter Peace Waters but may not attack unless war declared: this ensures a naval vessel
   always exists which can bring commerce units to coastal cities; and realistically reflects the historic use of real Galleons.
Spy Plane correctly made to be unreachable to propeller-based aircraft.
Can't make road-types while transported in foreign lands (road/quay/rail/maglev/canal)
   move to mp2-brava
+1/9 move bonus for v4+ aircraft was changed to +1, as it too frequently led to death of precious v4 units from tired attack on last move.
   move to MP2-brava
Ships cost 2x to bribe -- injured ships far from home had too low bribe costs for what you're getting.
Ram Ship can see 1 tile around it and travel on rivers - prevents unintended attacks when travelling diagonally.
   move to MP2-brava (except not the travel on river part)
Damaged Submarine min_speed=4 (was 3); makes hit-and-run and escape somewhat more viable.
Nuclear winter is was patches of random arctic everywhere, now is more of a temperature downgrade of each affected tile to one level colder.
Fallout disappear chance changed from 20% to 15%
Starting Caravans have all restrictions and complications removed. Can Help Wonder or Establish Trade Route (remember to set Home City first!)
Camels move faster than people, Caravans get 2 7/9 moves. They can also carry 2 Goods units. 
Capturable commerce units can't become uncapturable just by carrying Goods or being on same tile with other capturable commerce units.
   Put another unit_type with them. This prevents mere cargo from making commerce units immune to capture.  Cargo becomes lost in capture 
   event: e.g., Caravan carrying goods gets captured. Goods are lost, Caravan transfers ownership.
Tribesmen gain 1 HP and can fight back. A1D1 HP6. It might be just enough for 2 of them to fight off 1 intruder unit, if one dies ;)
Coastal Defense is visible without middle-clicking for city info.
Masonry is not needed for Palace (simplification)

SERVER UPGRADES:
1. Special Unit Actions / Attacks:
   a. can optionally specify a move cost up to 7 moves points.
   b. can optionally specify a limit to number of units on tile which can be hit
   c. can optionally specify a maximum number of units who can be potentially killed
   d. can optionally specify a unit stays fortified when doing the action.
2. Population units can specify pop-cost and add-pop differently. 
3. Non-diplomatic units can be made to enter "direct combat with buildings": e.g., Siege Ram vs. City Walls. 
5. Bulb cost displays now reflect non-default sciencebox settings 
6. Fixed design flaw in server that made pop-cost units take up all a city's build slots.  
7. Made units-display in lower-right update correctly more often (not showing dead/spent/disbanded units.) Please report any exceptional cases.
8. Fixed possibilities for some rare backdoors.
9. DIPLOMATIC ACTION REPORTING TRANSPARENCY: all diplomatic actions show the odds and results for all stages to both contestants.
10. Unit vision range now reported in raw tile units rather than square of radius.
11. Fortresses and Naval Bases show a flag of who owns them to prevent confusion, fixed first version incorrectly showed a buoy.
12. Fixed variety of small quirks/inconsistencies in loading/unloading of transports.
13. Added ability for rulesets to include the "Sea Bridge" improvement over water. Must be CAdjacent on lake or ocean (not deep ocean)
16. Hovering over a Special Unit Attack button in the Attack pop-up window, now gives info-text for all its special traits and requirements (from mp2-c onward)
17. Fixed rounding errors in displayed upgrade costs on client side.
18. Fixed upstream server bug that didn't allow capture units to trigger casus belli.
19. Added ability for effects to be triggered by unit activity states (instead of only completed actions.)
20. There was a hidden flaw in 3.0 server, any unit who can do ANYTHING to a tile gets magic bonus to also clean pollution and fallout. 
      This was affecting foot soldiers (who can make hideouts) so we went with the flow. But now this flaw is fixed, and we're back to the
      classical orthodoxy:  only non-military tile workers can clean fallout and pollution (worker, engineer, settler, proletarian)
21. A bug in main freeciv server caused climate change to lag, often not completing for several minutes, with a high probability of crashing.  This exists in all
    versions of freeciv but FCW had to hard-code global warming out because the problem was exponentially worse on larger maps.
    This now has following fixes and upgrades:
    1. New settings for STRENGTH of nuclear winter and global warming exist (how much of earth is affected if triggered.)
    2. New percent setting allows adjusting the threshold that triggers climate events, and the tolerance/absorption of the earth to diminish 
       the accumulation of impact over time.
    3. TC Climate Change processing takes onyl seconds instead of several minutes.
    4. It doesn't crash.
    5. Note: the defaults for these settings were always ON in all games, they were just not triggered because a patch prevented their 
       execution to prevent crashing. So, be careful of global warming.
    6. New feature: IPCC report gives transparency on risk of climate change if the risk starts to escalate.  
    7. Climate Report is now in Gov tab.
22. Landmass can be set from 10 to 99 (was 15 to 85)
UI / Ease of use / Macro-management mechanics.
23. Mass select Airlift: you can select multiple units and give them simultaneous airlift command, which will execute in sequential order if each is legal.
    This upgrades one-at-a-time airlifting.
24 Intelligent Load/Unload/Activate Cargo are now upgraded to work holistically with each other.
   UNLOAD TRANSPORT 'T':
    a. 'T' tells a selected Transport(s) to unload their specific cargo.
    b. 'T' tells selected Cargo to unload from their Transports. 
   LOAD 'L': 
    a. 'L' Load selected units on Transport(s).
    b. 'L' Load ONE selected Transport with all units on the tile which it can legally take as cargo. ("Cargo Scoop")
    c. 'L' Transfer selected Cargo units to other Transports IFF such action would be legal if the cargo can legally unload then reload. 
    d. 'L' command given at Sea, to tell selected Cargo to move to a new Transport, is legal if current Transport has moved no more than 4
        moves and has at least 3 moves left.
    
    has used half or more of its 
           moves AND has more than 3 moves left. This may seem complex but it is a "Sweet spot" compromise to allow legitimate "Transport transfer"
           while hindering the "Transport shuffle" exploit.
   SELECT CARGO on TRANSPORT 'U':
    a. 'U' command will only select Cargo units on the SELECTED Transport(s).
    b. If no Transport is selected, 'U' commamnd does its old behaviour to select ALL cargo units on the tile.
   What no longer happens:
   1. 'T' will never do as previously, it unloaded ALL cargo on same tile, making multiple load/unload operations tedious.
   2. 'U' command will never select all cargo on same tile, only on selected Transports.
   3. 'L' command won't disallow swapping Cargo between Transports in cities because you didn't take the extra step of unloading first.
   4. 'L' command doesn't force you to click-select every unit you want to load. Now you can select the Transport who scoops up all legal units instead.
24a. Can "Transport swap" Land-type cargo units in
   1) where it's legal to unload anyway, to save an extra step (cities, naval bases, quays)
   2) in sea units who have enough moves (see 24.'L.d.)
25. iPillage - this uses the server's new surgical strike pillage feature, where tiles can be destroyed in real-time on par with everything else
    (buildingis, units, etc.)  iPillage brings Scorched Earth and Blitzkrieg into the game; gives Air Strikes more of a real purpose, increases 
    the tactical importance of Vigil, as well as the placement of Forts, more Foot soldiers, and AAA, to protect regional infrastructure. 
    Features can be set for each unit:
      success odds, move cost, pin-point single target, or multiple random targets in one strike.
      note: the documented iPillage odds go up +5% for each veteran level.
26. Added "gold per shield" info to the City screen (custom user column) and on pop-up window to buy item.
27. Added option to enter Full Screen (full immersion) like every non-browser game, when the game launches. ESC is now dedicated to exiting 
    Full Immersion (ALT-S or Options>>Full Screen) to re-enter. You are no longer required to hit ESC to exit tabs and pop-up windows, and lose 
    full screen display. Instead, the command to exit any tab or pop-up window is "W" for (W)ithdraw (W)indow. This now allows the game to default 
    into an orthodox full screen experience like Freeciv Native Client and EVERY OTHER GAME, instead of being a "second class browser game."
   Recommended: become familiar with your OS's hotkeys, which better enable you to navigate while having a fullscreen process:
28. Fortify given to non-fortifiable units will sentry them instead, and if they can't sentry, they will be given "No Orders" (J) and stay put.
    This turns the F key into the magic spam key for making unit(s) stay put and select their best option on the tile. It allows giving F
    to a large stack and every unit who can fortify will, while sentrying the rest, so you can move on, and maybe spam F again, rapidly.
    Reason: quicker/easier micro-management during late game.
28a. Sentry given to non-sentryable units will NO-ORDERS them instead.
29. Triremes on sentry on all legal refueling spots (formerly could not sentry on coastline.)
30. Size 1 cities aren't impervious to infinite nukes while every other city is cut in half each time. Now s1 cities die if nuked.
31. Investigate City now has:
     1. "diplchance" odds (80%) of avoiding diplomatic battle even if enemy spy is present (was 100%) - "Covert Slip Attempt"
     2. Then [possibly] diplomatic battle,
     3. Then "diplchance"+(ruleset odds) chance to succeed. MP2 gives a +5% over base diplchance of 80, or 85% chance to succeed at this phase.
What this means for MP2 rules: 
   80% chance to slip past enemy diplomats/spies without diplomatic combat. (100% if unprotected)
   If slipped past OR defeated enemy diplomats in combat, 85% chance to succeed at investigating city.
   Thus, 85% chance to investigate unprotected city, and about 75% chance to succeed vs. protected city (plus or minus with vet levels of spies.)
32. Spies could only sabotage city production at random but not targeted. This was fixed: targeted sabotage now lists "Production" as one of the 
   choices along with the improvements.
33. Info-codes. Special info symbols mark the messages you get in the chat window, to make it easier/faster to scan and read important events,
    or to scroll back to find again.
34. 3 NEW DEMOGRAPHICS statistics: Units Built, Units Killed, Units Lost. We can also select which rows in demographics report to show, and also 
    which of 3 columns to turn on (your quantitative score, your rank, who is #1 and their quantitative score [if you have embassy])
35. Discovery of new government gives instant click-link icon to change government, in the chat window.
36. Recycling Unit is smarter to differentiate single or plural simultaneous; and differentiate a disbanding from a recycling into production. Also new 
   Orders button for Recycle/Disband has same intelligence to it.
37 CTRL-click: clicks a tile as if a city is not there: good for selecting units without extra UI fussing (going inside a city to pick the unit etc.)
38. Special retaliation ability: units defending from ranged attacks now have the potential to retaliate if they also can range attack...
    "ranged defense".  This opens up new tactics currently given only to units that benefit from big balance improvement from it 
    (Archer, Battleship, Helicopter.) Note that ranged defense requires there to be move points left.
        one Bship bombards 2, now they have 37 hp and 1 Bship beats both. This prevents such possibilities and indeed, 
        the 2 battleships properly retaliate leaving the single Bship in worse, not better condition. This dynamic is
        carefully used to allow deeper level of tactics for some units and to slightly buff units whose special
        role abilities were represented weaker than the realistic and tactical use they should have.
39. fixed rounding errors in calculation of move points on damaged units.
40. adding a pop unit to a city arranges tiles by its CMA (server default or governor) instead of making entertainer. 
41. TC reports on UWT activity delays now only report activities that finish this turn; Not anymore, e.g., transform or mine that finishes on a future turn.
42. possibly fixed spurious message re:UWT
