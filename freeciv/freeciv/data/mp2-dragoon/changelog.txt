Focus goals for MP2-Dragoon

============================= CHANGES ======================
1. Granary Size, Population Changes:
       S2  S3  S4  S5  S6  S7 
MP2C:  20  30  40  50  60  70   20+10...
MP2D:  16  23  31  40  50  60  70  71  16+7+8+9+10...up to 70 then +1
Although this speeds the early game up which is arguably 
a nice secondary bonus, the actual purpose for this change
is in curing an imbalance in the Discrete Mathematics of 
the foodbox system. This smooths over a flaw in that
system which heavily discourages size 3 cities under 
despotism and early expansion AND discouraged new 
cities for the last 40% of the game.
============================================================
2. Mountain Goats (3 1 0) & Hippopotami (3 1 0)
============================================================
3. Goods available with Pottery. Besides giving starting
Tribesmen and Caravan something to carry, and being more 
realistic, it brings to life the original purpose of
this virtual unit for the early game.
============================================================
4. "Advisor" for buildings suggests an order similar to 
   an experienced player, instead of alphabetic.
============================================================
5. LandRoad is native to Grassland, Plains, Tundra; just uses
   a full move point.
============================================================
6. Under Despotism, All new cities get +2 food when
   founded (+4 for capital).
   ...
   Scarcity and hard survivalism both under despotism and 
   resourcefulness of nomadic ways, resulted in people
   hoarding preserved food sources.
   1. This reduces the early game "slow period" by about 1 turn.
   2. It furthers the project of quantitative easing against the
   forcing-effect of "leave Despotism for Monarchy ASAP".
   Gradually people will wake up into realising a multiplicity
   of Bronze Age diversity exists. 
============================================================
7. With Pyramids, cities start with +6 food. (Was 5 in MP2C).
   6/16 rather than 5/20 compensates the increase in cost and
   science requirements. Pyramid strategies will be more
   non-conformist, rare, and more of a commitment, but also
   more interesting.
============================================================
8. Partisans can investigate conquered cities not owned 
   by the original owner.
============================================================
