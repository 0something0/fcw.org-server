Basically you can help improve Freeciv-web in any way you like, as long at it actually makes the game better!

Major:
- Update Freeciv-web to work with latest Freeciv.org SVN trunk version.
- Integrate Freeciv-web into Freeciv.org codebase as much as possible.
- Remove need for patches in /freeciv/patches directory.
- Remove freeciv-proxy, integrate a WebSocket server into the freeciv C server. Integrate http://libwebsockets.org into the Freeciv C server. This is a lot of work.
- Add better goto handling with display of the number of turns required for goto

Medium:
- Implement city production worklists. 
- Playback of games.
- Show attack prompts. At the moment, gotos can result in unwanted attacks.
- Show what city is a unit's homecity. 
- Statue of liberty doesn't allow all governments.
- Better interface to load units into boats and transports.
- Planes goto get blocked by ground units.
- Show number of turns a diplomatic agreement will last.
- diplomats inside cities can't see units there.
- Sometimes other countries won't "meet" even if you're in contact and are on good terms.
- Cannot disband unit in city to gain half production back. However, disbanding on the map still seems to give you that bonus. It's just not clear/available in the city dialog. 


Minor/Other:
- Separate chat box from other messages.
- WebGl?
