TODO:
-----

Current TODO-list in prioritized order here:

- City reports seem to be missing. I'd really love to have a list of my cities, what they are building, how many turns left for each item, the current state of citizens (unhappy, happy, taxmen, entertainers, scientists, etc)
- On the "Production" Screen, it would be nice if we had the attack/defense/movements of each unit list
- Units seem to get "stuck" if you try to move them beyond the number of moves they have remaining. They're not sentried, they're not moving, they're just forgotten and not cycled through on the next turn. They have the "G" next to them, but don't go anywhere.
- On the City detail page, the citizen icons are too small to see what they mean, there also appears to be a black line around each block which appears unnecessary.
- Three back-to-back (i.e same turn) successful spy/diplomat sabotages on the same city should not destroy production on the same item if the previous spy just destroyed the production.
- There is no "Unload" hotkey for ships containing units to be unloaded. You have to click on the ship, then select each unit one by one, and it the ship has finished it's moves, the map recenters to the capital and then I have to go back and find the ship and repeat the process.
- There doesn't appear to be a way to rearrange the items in the worklist. If I have a long worklist, I have to remove everything if I want to insert something, then re-add everything back in.
- Upgrade doesn't provide me an option if I want to upgrade given the cost of the upgrade before it happens.

Various:
- Let the player find another player's (known) capital without having to middle click every visible city he owns. Could be based on solution to Freeciv bug #23790
- The trade route tab of the city tab should show if there is room for more trade routes

Basically you can help improve Freeciv-web in any way you like, as long at it actually makes the game better! Other things to improve there:

Major:
- Update Freeciv-web to work with latest Freeciv.org SVN trunk version.
- Integrate Freeciv-web into Freeciv.org codebase as much as possible.
- Merge all dialogs to use Handlebars templates. See city dialog for a starting example. http://handlebarsjs.com/
- Remove need for patches in /freeciv/patches directory.
- Remove freeciv-proxy, integrate a WebSocket server into the freeciv C server. Integrate http://libwebsockets.org into the Freeciv C server. This will be useful! 
- Add better goto handling with display of the number of turns required for goto

Medium:
- Playback of games.
- Show attack prompts. At the moment, gotos can result in unwanted attacks.
- Show what city is a unit's homecity. 
- Statue of liberty doesn't allow all governments.
- Better interface to load units into boats and transports.
- Planes goto get blocked by ground units.
- Show number of turns a diplomatic agreement will last.
- diplomats inside cities can't see units there.
- Sometimes other countries won't "meet" even if you're in contact and are on good terms.
- Cannot disband unit in city to gain half production back. However, disbanding on the map still seems to give you that bonus. It's just not clear/available in the city dialog. 


Minor/Other:
- Separate chat box from other messages.
- WebGl?


Unimplemented Freeciv client features:
- global work lists
- advanced unit selection
- the auto generated part of the help texts
- the spy action targeted sabotage
- the spy action targeted steal tech

Simplify Freeciv server upgrade:
- document what changes in Freeciv to be extra aware of and what they can break
- add automatic ruleset upgrade sanity checks.
  - should they run automatically?
    - positive: forces the updater to review stuff
    - negative: may train the updater to ignore its output
- get rid of the worst merge conflict causes
  - city_name_bugfix:
    - get it into Freeciv
  - freeciv_web_all_packets_def_changes:
    - find and get rid of pointless changes
    - make more changes pointless by improving Freeciv's JSON support
