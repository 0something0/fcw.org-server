TODO:
-----

Current TODO-list in prioritized order here:

- City reports seem to be missing. I'd really love to have a list of my cities, what they are building, how many turns left for each item, the current state of citizens (unhappy, happy, taxmen, entertainers, scientists, etc)
- On the "Production" Screen, it would be nice if we had the attack/defense/movements of each unit list
- Units seem to get "stuck" if you try to move them beyond the number of moves they have remaining. They're not sentried, they're not moving, they're just forgotten and not cycled through on the next turn. They have the "G" next to them, but don't go anywhere.
- On the City detail page, the citizen icons are too small to see what they mean, there also appears to be a black line around each block which appears unnecessary.
- Three back-to-back (i.e same turn) successful spy/diplomat sabotages on the same city should not destroy production on the same item if the previous spy just destroyed the production.
- There is no "Unload" hotkey for ships containing units to be unloaded. You have to click on the ship, then select each unit one by one, and it the ship has finished it's moves, the map recenters to the capital and then I have to go back and find the ship and repeat the process.
- There doesn't appear to be a way to rearrange the items in the worklist. If I have a long worklist, I have to remove everything if I want to insert something, then re-add everything back in.
- Upgrade doesn't provide me an option if I want to upgrade given the cost of the upgrade before it happens.

Various:
- Let the player find another player's (known) capital without having to middle click every visible city he owns. Could be based on solution to Freeciv bug #23790
- The trade route tab of the city tab should show if there is room for more trade routes
- Make it possible to upload a save game without having to start a new game first when no other save games are stored in the browser

Basically you can help improve Freeciv-web in any way you like, as long at it actually makes the game better! Other things to improve there:

Major:
- Update Freeciv-web to work with latest Freeciv.org SVN trunk version.
- Integrate Freeciv-web into Freeciv.org codebase as much as possible.
- Merge all dialogs to use Handlebars templates. See city dialog for a starting example. http://handlebarsjs.com/
- Remove need for patches in /freeciv/patches directory.
- Remove freeciv-proxy, integrate a WebSocket server into the freeciv C server. Integrate http://libwebsockets.org into the Freeciv C server. This will be useful! 
- Add better goto handling with display of the number of turns required for goto

Medium:
- Playback of games.
- Show attack prompts. At the moment, gotos can result in unwanted attacks.
- Show what city is a unit's homecity. 
- Statue of liberty doesn't allow all governments.
- Better interface to load units into boats and transports.
- Planes goto get blocked by ground units.
- Show number of turns a diplomatic agreement will last.
- diplomats inside cities can't see units there.
- Sometimes other countries won't "meet" even if you're in contact and are on good terms.
- Cannot disband unit in city to gain half production back. However, disbanding on the map still seems to give you that bonus. It's just not clear/available in the city dialog. 


Minor/Other:
- Separate chat box from other messages.

User Interface:
- Does the Go To And Do X user interaction style fit Freeciv-web's UI design?
  - The goto system handles "must have moves left to perform this action" rules
    - Could perhaps avoid some user confusion? See https://youtu.be/tNYqzg2HwRE?t=5m46s
  - Allows the user to specify the order before the unit moves into harms way
  - Example: Freeciv-web's Detonate Nuke At menu item and unit order button
  - Example: The Qt client's auto generated go to and... sub menu
  - Where should it live?
    - In a Go To And... sub menu of the unit context menu?
    - Should unit order buttons change? How?
  - How to handle stuff that may have changed its legality when the unit reaches its target?
    - Example: Join the city that will be built at the target tile next turn.
    - Example: Build a city at the tile where the enemy will build a city next turn.
    - The Qt client currently shows everything a unit type can do in case it will become legal.
      - Automatically finding all actions a unit may become able to perform in the future is non trivial in Freeciv-web
- How should known illegal actions be handled?
  - An action is known illegal when:
    - the unit can perform it
    - the unit can't perform it right now
    - the player has enough information to known this
  - A known illegal action can be shown and sent to the server
    - The server often tries to explain why the failed action was illegal. The explanation helps the player to discover the rules.
    - Offering to perform it can annoy and confuse the player. See https://youtu.be/tNYqzg2HwRE?t=6m31s
  - A known illegal action can be hidden
    - This could lead the player to assume that the unit can't perform the action at all
  - A known illegal action can be "grayed out"
    - the player sees that the unit can do the action but not right now
    - many "grayed out" actions cluttering the view can be messy and confusing
  - How much effort should be spent on discovering known illegal actions?
    - Is requesting a list of legal actions from the server on each menu update too expensive?
  - Current situation:
    - the action selection dialog doesn't show known illegal actions
    - some menu items show and allows the player to order known illegal actions
    - Automatically finding all actions a unit may become able to perform in the future is non trivial in Freeciv-web
    - PACKET_UNIT_GET_ACTIONS has the disturb_player field for background queries

Unimplemented Freeciv client features:
- global work lists
- advanced unit selection
- rearranging items in the city production work list
- the cities tab
- the auto generated part of the help texts
  - the code is big (it also refers to other Freeciv C code)
  - "just rewrite the code in JavaScript"
    - would be much work
    - keeping it updated as the corresponding code changes in Freeciv would be a nightmare
    - high probability of it ending up telling lies
  - make freeciv-manual output something Freeciv-web can read
    - could be done during the Freeciv-web build
    - have Freeciv-web look up the correct file given the current ruleset
    - mark the parts Freeciv-web wants (like the list of facts about a unit type)
- between turns timer count down

Simplify Freeciv server upgrade:
- add automatic ruleset upgrade sanity checks.
  - should they run automatically?
    - positive: forces the updater to review stuff
    - negative: may train the updater to ignore its output
- get rid of the worst merge conflict causes
  - freeciv_web_all_packets_def_changes:
    - find and get rid of pointless changes
    - make more changes pointless by improving Freeciv's JSON support
