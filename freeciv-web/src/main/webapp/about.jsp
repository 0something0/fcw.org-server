<h2>About Freeciv.net</h2>
<span>
Freeciv.net is an open source project, released under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">GNU Affero General Public License 3.0 or later</a>.
The project is a fork of the C server from Freeciv.org, which has origins back to 1996. The idea of creating a version for Freeciv 
which would be playable online in a browser came about some time in 2007, and this project has evolved into what it is now since then.
<br><br>
Freeciv.net requires a browser which supports HTML5 canvas, and a fast computer and internet connection.
