<h1>Keyboard and Mouse Controls</h1>
The game is played using a combination of keyboard and mouse controls.<br>
These unit command icons are used to give instructions to your units on
the map.<br>
Usually you have to first select a unit, then click on the command.<br>
<br>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">

      <td style="text-align: center;"><kbd>G</kbd></td>
      <td><strong>Unit goto:</strong> This command is used
to move units around the map. First select the unit you want to move,
then click on this command, and finally click on the tile that you want
your unit to move to.The player may order a unit to go to a target
square anywhere on the map. From
that point, the game will plan a route for the unit, which the unit
will follow turn
after turn until it reaches the goal. In each turn, the unit will make
as much
progress as its movement point allowance permits. Once it reaches its
goal it
becomes ready for your orders. While in transit it is marked on the map
with a "G";
if you click on it from the map window, you clear its Go To status. </td>

      <td><strong>Fortify:</strong>
Any land unit (other than Settlers and Engineers) may fortify, which
means to place
itself temporarily in a better posture to defend; this is different
from constructing a
permanent Fortress. It takes effect immediately. A fortified unit has
its defense
strength multiplied by 1.5, and regains lost hit
points more rapidly. </td>
