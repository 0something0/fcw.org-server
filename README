Overview
--------

The Freeciv Web client consists of these components:

* freeciv - a fork of the main Freeciv C client and server.

* freeciv-proxy - a HTTP proxy which allows web client users
  to connect to Freeciv civservers. This proxy converts C packets
  to and from JSON.

* freeciv-web - a Java web application for the Freeciv web client.
  This application is a AJAX application which consists of HTML,
  Javascript, images and JSP files which make up the application
  viewed in each user's web browser. 

* freeciv-img-extract - extracts the images of the Freeciv tileset,
  and generates a version for the web. This produces a tileset PNG 
  and Javascript. Run this to sync with the upstream Freeciv SVN 
  repository.

* publite2 - a simple way to launch multiple civservers. 

* freeciv-music - contains music which can be played during the game.

Compiling and running the Freeciv Web client
---------------------------------

1. Install the system requirements. 

2. Create mysql database called 'freecivmetaserver'
   Import mysql dump into a MySQL database from:  /publite2/mysqldump.sql.bz2

3. Build and configure freeciv-web. 

   - Edit /freeciv-web/src/main/webapp/freecivmetaserve/php_code/settings.php.dist,
     rename this file to settings.php, and update values for fcdb_username and fcdb_pw
     to your MySQL username and password.
   - Edit /freeciv-web/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/resin-web.xml.dist, rename this
     file to resin-web.xml, and update the values for your MySQL database.
   - Run 'build.sh' in the freeciv-web directory

4. Compile and install Freeciv. This involves running the following commands:
   cd freeciv 
   ./autogen.sh --enable-client=no
   make
   make install     (as root user)

   Create the Freeciv savegame directory:  /mnt/savegames
   and make it writeable by the user running publite.


5. Start resin with these commands:  
   cd /opt/resin/bin
   ./resin.sh start

6. Start publite2:
  Run publite2_single.py in the publite2 directory.

7. Run the freeciv-proxy:
  Run run.sh in the freeciv-proxy directory.
 To debug, check the proxy debugging page: 
http://localhost/civ/status
http://localhost:8082/civ/status

8. Start nginx on port 80 as root.

9. Start the web client in your browser:
   Point your web browser to http://localhost/

10. Continue to play the game. 

FIXME: Had to add -lssl when compiling server...




Also: 
Set ulimit -n 65535 in /etc/profile
and add some TCP/IP tuning in /etc/sysctrl.conf
